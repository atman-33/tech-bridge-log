How to Set Up Serena MCP with Qoder on Windows

## 1. Prerequisites

*   Windows 10/11
*   [Qoder](https://qoder.com) is installed
*   [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is installed via WinGet or another method (`uvx.exe` is available)
*   Git for Windows is installed, and `git --version` can be run in PowerShell

https://qoder.com

## 2. Problem Overview

While Serena MCP runs correctly in a WSL environment, the following issues occur on native Windows:

*   When launched with a `stdio` connection, Qoder does not communicate with Serena after startup.
*   With a `streamable-http` connection, Qoder accesses the root (`/`) and receives a 404 error.

This results in a state where "Qoder cannot connect to Serena."

## 3. Verified Solution

### 3.1 Manually Start Serena as an HTTP Server

First, run the following command in PowerShell to start Serena MCP in `streamable-http` mode.

```powershell
uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena start-mcp-server --context ide-assistant --transport streamable-http
```

*   By default, the server starts at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
*   A "StreamableHTTP session manager started" message in the log indicates a successful launch.

### 3.2 Configure mcp.json in Qoder

Configure Qoder to use Serena MCP via an HTTP connection.
The key is to set the **URL to `/mcp`**, as the root (`/`) will result in a 404 error.

```json
"serena": {
  "type": "streamableHttp",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
}
```

After this, enabling "MCP" in Qoder will establish the connection from Qoder to Serena.

## 4. Important Notes

*   This requires the manual step of starting Serena.
*   If you want Serena to run persistently, you can use the **Windows Task Scheduler** to launch it automatically on logon.

## 5. Summary

1.  Start Serena MCP with `--transport streamable-http` in PowerShell.
2.  Set the `url` in Qoder's `mcp.json` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`.
3.  Optionally, use Task Scheduler to automate the launch.
