Kiro for Codex is a VS Code extension that brings the best of Kiro's Spec‚ÄëDriven Development into a Codex‚Äëcentric workflow. It centralizes Specs, Steering Docs, and Prompts so you can generate, review, and execute from one place‚Äîwithout leaving your editor.

Available on the VS Code Marketplace:

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=atman-dev.kiro-for-codex

## TL;DR

- Integrates with Codex CLI to generate and manage requirements, design, and tasks directly in VS Code
- Visualizes Specs in a sidebar; run each task from `tasks.md` via CodeLens and auto‚Äëcheck it off
- Treat Steering Docs and Prompts as shared workspace assets to reduce decision friction
- Inspired by [notdp/kiro-for-cc](https://github.com/notdp/kiro-for-cc), redesigned around Codex CLI

## Motivation & Approach

Kiro excels at a spec‚Äëfirst workflow with a thoughtful UI and model usage that meaningfully improves developer experience. I use Codex daily, so I wanted to recreate‚Äîand extend‚Äîthat experience around Codex. Using [notdp/kiro-for-cc](https://github.com/notdp/kiro-for-cc) as a reference, this extension reworks the interactions, structure, and artifacts to fit Codex tightly.

## Core Features

### SPEC Management
- Create Specs: scaffold Requirements / Design / Tasks via Codex CLI
- Visual Explorer: browse and manage Specs from the sidebar
- Spec Workflow: review each stage (Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks)
- CodeLens for Tasks: run individual tasks from `tasks.md` and auto‚Äëmark as done

### STEERING Management
- Steering Documents: browse and edit global/project‚Äëspecific guidelines
- Generated Docs: product, tech, and structure steering documents

### PROMPTS
- Create Prompts: scaffold `.codex/prompts/<name>.md` from the Prompts view
- Click to Open: open the prompt Markdown for quick review
- Inline Run Button: use ‚ñ∂ to execute with Codex CLI in place
- Organize & Refresh: maintain a workspace prompt library with quick refresh
- Markdown Simplicity: plain Markdown‚Äîno front matter required

## Who It's For
- Individuals or small teams who want a smooth path from specs to implementation
- Developers who rely on Codex CLI and prefer to stay in VS Code
- Teams who value Specs, decision guidelines (Steering), and Prompts as shared assets

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- VS Code (latest)
- Codex CLI installed (`codex --version`)
- Permission to run commands at the project root

### Installation
- Marketplace: install from the listing above
- From VSIX (alternative):
  - VS Code: Extensions ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Install from VSIX
  - CLI: `code --install-extension ./kiro-for-codex-x.y.z.vsix`

## Quick Start
1. Open your workspace
2. Open the ‚ÄúKiro for Codex‚Äù sidebar
3. Run ‚ÄúCreate Specs‚Äù to scaffold Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks
4. Use CodeLens ‚ñ∂ in `tasks.md` to run tasks individually
5. Curate Steering/Prompts so repeated decisions and steps become reusable assets

## Architecture
- Sidebar views and CodeLens built with the VS Code Extension API
- Safely invokes Codex CLI and writes generated artifacts (Specs/Docs/Prompts) into the workspace
- Unifies creation and review in one UI to cut context‚Äëswitching

## Differences vs. Kiro / Claude Code
- Preserves the spirit of Kiro while optimizing IO layout and execution units for Codex CLI
- Learns UI/interaction patterns from [notdp/kiro-for-cc](https://github.com/notdp/kiro-for-cc) and adapts them to Codex‚Äëspecific workflows

## Use Cases
- Rapidly settle requirements ‚Üí design ‚Üí task breakdown for new projects
- Drive work in small increments and visualize progress via tasks
- Capture product/tech decision criteria (Steering) and reuse them across projects

## Troubleshooting
- Codex not found: verify PATH with `codex --version`
- Execution fails: check permissions at the workspace root and line endings
- Windows issues: confirm shell configuration (PowerShell/WSL)

## Roadmap
- Richer settings UI

## Closing

The goal is to bring Kiro‚Äôs delightful flow into a Codex‚Äëfirst daily development loop in VS Code. Feedback and contributions are welcome‚Äîissues and PRs appreciated.
