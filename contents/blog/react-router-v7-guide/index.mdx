# React Router v7: A Complete Migration Guide

React Router v7 brings significant improvements to routing in React applications, including better TypeScript support, enhanced data loading patterns, and improved developer experience. This guide will walk you through the migration process and highlight the key new features.

## What's New in React Router v7

The latest version introduces several game-changing features:

- **File-based routing** with automatic route generation
- **Enhanced data loading** with built-in loaders and actions
- **Better TypeScript support** with automatic type generation
- **Improved error handling** with error boundaries
- **Server-side rendering** optimizations

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update Your Dependencies

First, update your package.json to use React Router v7:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-router": "^7.0.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^7.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 2. Restructure Your Routes

Convert from programmatic routing to file-based routing:

```typescript
// Before (v6)
import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <Root />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "dashboard",
        element: <Dashboard />,
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```

```typescript
// After (v7) - File structure
// app/routes/route.tsx (root)
// app/routes/dashboard/route.tsx
```

### 3. Implement Data Loading

Use the new loader pattern for data fetching:

```typescript
import type { Route } from './+types/route';

export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const user = await fetchUser(params.id);
  return { user };
}

export default function UserProfile({ loaderData }: Route.ComponentProps) {
  const { user } = loaderData;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Benefits

### Type Safety

React Router v7 automatically generates TypeScript types for your routes:

```typescript
// Automatically generated types
interface LoaderData {
  user: User;
}

interface ActionData {
  success: boolean;
  errors?: string[];
}
```

### Performance Improvements

The new architecture provides better code splitting and lazy loading:

- Routes are automatically code-split
- Data loading happens in parallel with route loading
- Better caching strategies for repeated navigation

## Common Pitfalls

When migrating, watch out for these common issues:

1. **Route file naming**: Ensure you follow the correct naming conventions
2. **Data loading timing**: Loaders run before component rendering
3. **Error boundaries**: Implement proper error handling for failed data loads

## Conclusion

React Router v7 represents a significant step forward in React routing. The file-based approach, combined with enhanced TypeScript support and improved data loading patterns, makes it easier to build robust, type-safe applications.

Take your time with the migration, test thoroughly, and enjoy the improved developer experience!
