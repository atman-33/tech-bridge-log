## What You'll Find Here

Our blog covers a wide range of topics including:

- **Web Development**: Modern frameworks, best practices, and emerging technologies
- **Cloud Computing**: Serverless architectures, deployment strategies, and scalability
- **Developer Tools**: Productivity tips, workflow optimization, and tool reviews
- **Software Architecture**: Design patterns, system design, and architectural decisions

## Code Examples

Here's a simple TypeScript example to demonstrate syntax highlighting:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('User not found');
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

And here's a JavaScript example:

```javascript
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', active: true },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', active: false },
  { id: 3, name: 'Charlie', active: true }
];

const activeUsers = users
  .filter(user => user.active)
  .map(user => user.name);

console.log('Active users:', activeUsers);
```
